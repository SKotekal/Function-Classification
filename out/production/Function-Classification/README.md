# Function-Classification
This small project is a tiny taste of machine learning (supervised learning and regression). This code, when given an arbitrary set of (x, y) 
coordinates and error threshold, produces a polynomial function that approximates the data within the error margin. This implementation uses
the gradient descent algorithm to determine the values of the coefficients. I hope to extend the scope of this project from strictly polynomials
to more exotic functions, such as trigonometric, radical, and rational functions among others.
